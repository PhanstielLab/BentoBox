bb_readHic(hic, chrom, chromstart = NULL, chromend = NULL,
  resolution = 10000, zrange = NULL, norm = "KR", res_scale = "BP",
  altchrom = NULL, altchromstart = NULL, altchromend = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{hic}{path to .hic file}

\item{chrom}{if not alternative chromosome, chromosome of desired region}

\item{chromstart}{chromosome start position of chrom}

\item{chromend}{chromosome end position of chrom}

\item{resolution}{the width of each pixel}

\item{zrange}{the range of interaction scores to plot, where extreme values will be set to the max or min; if null, zrange will be set to (0, max(data))}

\item{norm}{hic data normalization; options are "NONE", "VC", "VC_SQRT", and "KR"}

\item{res_scale}{resolution scale; options are "BP" and "FRAG"}

\item{altchrom}{if looking at region between two different chromosomes, this is the specified alternative chromosome}

\item{altchromstart}{if looking at region between two different chromosomes, start position of altchrom}

\item{altchromend}{if looking at region between two different chromsomes, end position of altchrom}
